# Stockulus-Shift


Based on real trading data from Bloomberg api, we have created a real time streaming virtual stock trading game that streamed on twitch at http://twitch.tv/sentimentron. Like "Twitch plays pokemon", the idea is that users play one single instance of the game and vote on the next outcome of the stock choosing between either of 1) buy, 2) sell or 3) switch stock. The actual stock price is not influenced by the user decision, instead it is meant to see how well the crowd can predict real market data.
